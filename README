Hi Everybody,

Thanks for listening to my talk about support vector machines

If you would like to play around in this load up svm.rb in jruby and use the classes SvmTrain and SvmPrediction


An example would be:

`problem = [[5, {1 => 1, 4 => 1987}], [3, {2 => 1, 4 => 1978}], [2, {3 => 1, 4 => 1988}]]`
`svm_model = SvmTrain.new(problem)`
`svm_predictor = SvmPrediction.new(svm_model.model)`
`svm_predictor.predict( 1 => 1, 2 => 1 ) # yields 5 stars`
